# How to upgrade with images

## Ubuntu + Docker-engine + Tizen-Userspace Docker Image

In case that you use Tizen-based auto-driving software platform, we provide a convenient development environment
to developers by introducing OS-level container concept that is called docker. Currently, we support most of the
Linux distributions to use a Tizen-Userspace docker image. It means that you do not need to do the existing
complicated setting procedure to make your own development environment.

Please, refer to [Quick Guide](https://github.sec.samsung.net/RS7-AutoDriving/AutoDriving_Platform/blob/master/Documentation/quick-guide.md) page.
